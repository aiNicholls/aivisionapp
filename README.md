Android app using MSvision (now Azure AI). This app was designed to have surroundings and objects described to the user using text to speech, specifically to help with visually impaired users.
This application uses a custom camera and the user can take photos to describe a specific object or surrounding, or simply move the camera around and the text to speech will describe the environment live.
